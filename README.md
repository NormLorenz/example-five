# Example Five

This is a simple Python application that demonstrates basic functionality, including:
- Printing a greeting message with a name and age using the `main` function.
- A utility function `add` that returns the sum of two numbers.
- A placeholder function `junk` that currently does nothing.

The application is structured with a main script (`run.py`) that can execute the functionality defined in the `app/main.py` module.

## Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
python run.py
```

## Testing the Application
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
